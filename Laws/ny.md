thereof, owned by the state or of which it may obtain management, to the
extent that they constitute the habitat of fish and wildlife as defined in

maintenance and improvement of such resources as natural resources and the
development and administration of measures for making them accessible to the
people of the state. To obtain these results it shall include, to the extent
authorized by law, the undertaking and execution of reciprocal and cooperative
arrangements with the government of the United States, with other states, and
with other departments and agencies of this state, political subdivisions and
public corporations of this state and owners and lessees of privately owned
lands and waters, and shall also include continuation of research and
educational programs.

functions in the management of fish and wildlife resources of the state and
the execution of other duties imposed by law, the department is directed, in
the exercise of the powers conferred upon it, to develop and carry out
programs and procedures which will in its judgment, (a) promote natural
propagation and maintenance of desirable species in ecological balance, and

and maintenance on lands and waters of the state, whether owned by the state
or by a public corporation of the state or held in private ownership, having
regard to (1) ecological factors, including the need for restoration and
improvement of natural habitat and the importance of ecological balance in
maintaining natural resources; (2) the compatibility of production and
harvesting of fish and wildlife crops with other necessary or desirable land
uses; (3) the importance of fish and wildlife resources for recreational
purposes; (4) requirements for public safety; and (5) the need for adequate
protection of private premises and of the persons and property of occupants
thereof against abuse of privileges of access to such premises for hunting,
fishing or trapping.

by regulation measures for the management of striped bass, including size

Fisheries Commission and with applicable provisions of fishery management
plans adopted pursuant to the Federal Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(16 U.S.C. § 1800 et seq.).
