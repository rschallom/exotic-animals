• CAL. CODE REGS. Tit. 14 §671.1 - Permits for Restricted Species.

(a) General. It is unlawful for any person to import, export, transport,
maintain, dispose of, or use for any purpose any animal restricted by Section
671 except as authorized in a permit issued by the department.

(1) Limited Scope. A permit issued pursuant to this Section 671.1 does not
supersede any Federal, State, or local law regulating or prohibiting the
mammals or the activities authorized in the permit.

(2) Inspections. The department may approve an application prior to facilities
being inspected and approved. A permit shall not be issued unless the
applicant's facilities have been inspected and approved by the department or
persons designated by the department.

The department may enter any facility at a reasonable hour, where restricted
species are kept or may be kept to inspect animals, facilities, animal
equipment, or to inspect, audit, or copy any permit, book or record required
to be kept by these regulations or federal regulations relating to such
species.

(3) Change of Address or Name. The permittee must notify the Department's
License and Revenue Division, 3211 S Street, Sacramento, California 95816, in
writing of any change of address or name related to the permit within fourteen
(14) days of the change.

(4) Records. Any record, log, invoice, or other document required by this
Section 671.1 shall be maintained by the permittee for at least three years
from the date issued, and be made available to the department immediately upon
demand.

(5) Transportation Records Required of Broker/Dealer. The permittee shall
prepare and sign an invoice in duplicate prior to any animals leaving their
facility. The invoice shall contain the name and address of the Broker/Dealer,
a phone number where the Broker/Dealer and the consignee can be reached 24
hours, the name and address of the consignee, the date of the shipment, and
the number and scientific name of each animal. The invoice shall accompany the
animals being shipped. The consignee shall sign and date the invoice receipt
of the shipment and retain a copy.

(6) Permits for Business. A person (as defined in Fish and Game Code Section
67) other than a natural person can qualify for and be issued a permit, only
by employing at least one full time employee who possesses the requirements
for obtaining a permit. The permittee must continue to employ such qualified
persons as long as the animals are possessed in California.

(7) Financial Responsibility. The department may require an applicant for a
nonresident permit to provide proof he/she will immediately cover all expenses
incurred by the department for personnel, equipment, and facilities used to
locate, capture, house, care for, and transport animals that escape or that
are released or abandoned. The written proof must be in the form of an
insurance bond or other financial guarantee payable to the department, local
government agency, or entity contracting for the animals.

(8) Health Certificates. The department may require as a condition on any
permit that restricted animals be approved for interstate shipment pursuant to
applicable federal or state agency standards for diseases such as but not
limited to tuberculosis, brucellosis, and pseudo rabies. Permit conditions may
be more restrictive than federal standards.

(b) Permits and Fees. The following fees will be adjusted annually pursuant to
Section 699, Title 14, CCR. The department may issue permits with the
conditions it determines are necessary to protect native wildlife, agriculture
interests, animal welfare, and/or human health and safety to:

(1) Animal Care. A person who is a resident and who has the demonstrated
experience and ability to house an animal, and who legally possessed the
animal in California prior to January 1992. The permittee may only possess and
provide care for the animal(s) specifically listed on their department
approved permit inventory. No other activity is authorized except that which
is medically necessary for the care of the animal. The base permit fees for
this activity in 1998 are $34.75 for Welfare species and $289.50 for
Detrimental species.
